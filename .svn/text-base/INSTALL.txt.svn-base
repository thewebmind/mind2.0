# Instalation

TheWebMind's core was developed in PHP. Then, it's needed to have a working PHP environment configured in your machine or server, wherever you prefer to configura Mind.
First, download the project's content. Go to the download center to acquire the latest version, at: http://thewebmind.org/. 

# Requirements

To run TheWebMind you need:

    * PHP 5 or superior
    * HTTP Server (We recomend Apache)
    * A modern Browser*
    * Javascript on 

# To Linux users: TheWebMind needs to create and modify files and directories into its folder.
Be sure that the HTTP user (usualy www-data or apache) has access to read, write and execute, into it.

# After downloading theWebMind, unzip it into your server.
It's enough to have it working, and you can access it just hitting its address.
For example: http://localhost/thewebmind
